# Pomodoro Timer by NhDev

Hi! I'm NhDev, and I created this Pomodoro Timer web app to showcase my front-end engineering skills. This project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on the JavaScript side of things.

The Pomodoro Timer app features a simple, modern design with responsive elements and intuitive controls. Users can start and stop the timer, reset the cycle or step, and navigate between steps with ease. The timer follows the Pomodoro Technique, which consists of 25-minute work intervals followed by 5-minute breaks, and after completing four cycles, a longer 30-minute break is incorporated.

While building this project, I experimented with leveraging AI assistance to streamline the web development process and make it more efficient. The AI helped me with tasks such as generating code snippets, suggesting design improvements, and troubleshooting issues. This collaboration with AI allowed me to focus on my creative vision and make informed decisions, ultimately resulting in a better product.

Feel free to explore the code and get inspired to create your own projects! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
